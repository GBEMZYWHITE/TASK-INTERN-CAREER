Global Terorism Analysis.

This Data Analysis project attempts to provide information about Global Terrorism. firstly, my goal is to look into the dataset by doing a thorough data cleaning i.e deleting missing values, outliers, and extraneous columns to maintain the integrity and produce a quality report.

DATA SOURCE.

Global Terrorism Data: The dataset utilized in this research is the "Terrorism.csv" file which contains various information about attacks, weapons used, country and region where terrorist attacks took place, and so on. you can access the file below: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HrriUeyWZTlcAIDlpcWY4PU6k4DFOVav/view?usp=drive_link

TOOLS USED FOR THIS ANALYSIS.

-Microsoft Excel: For Cleaning the data i.e removing columns not needed for our analysis and so on.

-PowerBI: For turning unrelated data source into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.

The second file uploaded, the one with the name Intern career screenshot.png, shows the cleaned data i.e data needed for our analysis.

while the first file uploaded is the Visualisation outcome of the necessary data informationÂ required.
